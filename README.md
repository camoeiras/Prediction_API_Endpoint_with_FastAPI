# Prediction_API_Endpoint_with_FastAPI

We'll learn how to do that with FastAPI.FastAPI allows us to implement very efficient REST APIs with clear and lightweight syntax. Learn how to do this as efficiently as possible so that it can serve thousands of prediction requests. To help us with this task, we'll introduce another library, Joblib, that provides tools to help us serialize a trained model and cache predicted results.

This project cover the following topics: <br />

1- Persisting a treined model with Joblib <br />
2- Implementing an efficient prediction endpoint <br />
3- Cachin results with Joblib <br />

Technical Requirements <br />
Python 3.10.0 <br />
Pycharm 2021.2.3 <br />
Docker Conteiner <br />
